# Test IK-model
The python file called "model.py" plotts the body of Hubert when he tries to reach the position aquired by the user. Folowing steps are carried out every time a new position is given:
*A combination of angles are calculated using the IK-model
*The forward kinematics is then used to get the position of the different body parts
*The body parts are plotted and all angles updated in the plot to the right

Sliders are used to
